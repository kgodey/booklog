Review
------

My latest reads are Firstborn and Infinity Blade: Awakening, both by Brandon Sanderson, and I think e-books only. I bought them for the Kindle application on my Mac and read them today. I don't think I'm going to review them â€“ they were both so short (44 and 112 pages, respectively), and just fun reads.
