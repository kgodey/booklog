The Summer Tree by Guy Gavriel Kay
==================================

I'd heard a lot about Guy Gavriel Kay, so I decided to start reading The Fionavar Tapestry series. I liked it better than Dragon Wing, but I still wasn't that impressed. Some things didn't make sense to me - if Fionavar is the first of all worlds, why is it still so "primitive", especially if the people there know of modern day Earth (and can pretend to fit in here.)
