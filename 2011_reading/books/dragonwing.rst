Dragon Wing by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman
==============================================

I thought this book was okay - I found no fault with the writing or worldbuilding or the characters, really. I didn't find it very compelling, though - perhaps because of the lack of the unwitting/unwilling hero stereotype that I've come to associate with fantasy. I couldn't make myself care about the characters as much as I'd like to.

I'll keep reading the series, but I'm in no hurry. 3/5.
