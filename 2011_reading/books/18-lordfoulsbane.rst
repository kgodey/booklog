Lord Foul's Bane by Stephen R. Donaldson
========================================

Just finished Lord Foul's Bane by Stephen R. Donaldson. I think I liked it, but not enough to want to immediately want to read the next books.

I don't know why, but I don't enjoy the concept of people from present-day Earth getting transported to fantasy worlds. (The only exception to this I can think of is The Neverending Story.) I do enjoy urban fantasy/Harry Potter, etc. - just not modern people in medieval-type worlds. That's probably also why I didn't enjoy The Summer Tree as much as I thought I would.

Thomas Covenant was also an annoying protagonist. His character and behavior made sense based on what he went through, but I was still a bit disgusted that he raped a teenage girl and didn't really have to answer for it, plus he's lauded as a hero. I didn't really want to root for him.
