From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler by E.L. Konigsburg
=======================================================================

I wanted a light Friday night read, so I read From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler by E.L. Konigsburg. It was excellent, of course. Is it just me or are the children's books of the past much better than these days?
