The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making by Catherynne M. Valente 
===========================================================================================

I wish that I hadn’t jumped the gun in writing my “Best reads of 2011” post, since it’s still 2011 and The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making would have definitely been on it.

This book reminded me of The Phantom Tollbooth. That is is pretty much the highest praise I can give to a book. Other things that it had touches of: Roald Dahl’s quirky humour, Neil Gaiman’s whimsy and a world that reminded me a bit of The Neverending Story.

September, a girl from Omaha, Nebraska is given an opportunity to travel to Fairyland by the Green Wind, and of course she takes it. The book tells of her adventures there and her quest to defeat the evil Marquess. (I suppose there’s a touch of Oz in there, too.)

Catherynne M. Valente is known for her beautiful and evocative prose, and she definitely does not disappoint here. I sometimes find omniscient narrators a little annoying, but Valente makes it charming and delightful.

I loved that the story depends so much on September’s conscious choices, rather than her reacting to things that she happens to come across. I thought that was very well conveyed, and made September an captivating protagonist.

Summary: irresistible. Go read it now!
