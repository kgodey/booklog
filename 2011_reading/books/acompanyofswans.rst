A Company of Swans by Eva Ibbotson
==================================

I didn't like A Company of Swans as much as Ibbotson's other books. The romance was much more central to the story, and I'm not a romance reader. I also found the protagonist, Harriet, a little too meek and helpless for my tastes.
