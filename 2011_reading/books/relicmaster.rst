The Relic Master by Catherine Fisher
====================================

This book was a fun read, but probably not memorable enough to revisit. That's totally fine, though.

Anara is a world that's policed by a tyrannical Watch, and the Order of Keepers has been outlawed. We follow the Keeper Galen and his apprentice Raffi on their adventures. Carys, an undercover member of the Watch joins them on their journey.

Things I enjoyed:
- The combination of technology and fantasy - the descriptions of the Relics sound very similar to modern technology, but they seem to be artifacts of magical power. I loved the underpinnings of science fiction in this world of mostly mythological fantasy.
- Carys' character was done well, her thoughts and how her perceptions change made her seem real. There were no sudden turnarounds in character - everything was nice and gradual.
- I thought the Sekoi were an interesting addition, I can't wait to find out how they fit into this world.
- Galen and Raffi were good protagonists. Even though they weren't given too much detail or complexity, I was able to get a good sense of what they were like.
- I liked the alternating third/first person narration.

I'm definitely going to keep up with this series.
