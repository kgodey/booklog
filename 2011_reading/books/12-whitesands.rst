White Sands, Red Menace by Ellen Klages
=======================================

I read White Sands, Red Menace by Ellen Klages - it's a sequel to The Green Glass Sea, which is one of my favourite books. It's about a girl whose father works for the Manhattan Project and her life in Los Alamos. Everyone's parents are working on the atom bomb, and that's a very interesting place to set a book from a 12 year old girl's point of view. It isn't very dramatic or climactic, things just sort of happen. (Dramatic things do happen sometimes, but it isn't written dramatically.)

White Sands, Red Menace is set after the bomb goes off, and explores its aftermath, the passing of the Atomic Energy act, scientist households being strained by pacifism vs. more research etc. It's all written pretty unbiasedly and has the same slow-paced but satisfying feeling.
