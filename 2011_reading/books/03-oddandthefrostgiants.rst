Odd and the Frost Giants by Neil Gaiman
=======================================

I would hardly consider Odd and the Frost Giants a book; it was so short! I loved it, though - Gaiman is one of my favourite authors. I love mythological stories, and it was interesting to see Gaiman tackle Norse mythology so differently from his American Gods universe. The epic battles faced by the protagonists are not my favourite things about Gaiman's work, so it was great to have Odd outwitting the Frost Giant, instead of fighting him.
