The Star of Kazan by Eva Ibbotson
=================================

It was pretty standard fare (and great, of course.) There were far fewer coincidental relationships in the book - usually every major character turns out to be someone's long-lost something or the other, but that didn't happen! I think I'm going to take a break from Ibbotson for a bit, though - I'm not enjoying her books as much as I usually do. I own four more that I have not read - The Dragonfly Pool, The Haunting of Granite Falls, The Beast of Clawstone Castle and The Morning Gift.
