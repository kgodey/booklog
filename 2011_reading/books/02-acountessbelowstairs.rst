A Countess Below Stairs by Eva Ibbotson
=======================================

I really enjoyed A Countess Below Stairs, despite not really liking the romance genre (and the romance was my least favourite part.) However, I did enjoy a slightly more adult version of Ibbotosn's style of storytelling. Her books are always a pleasure to read; you can be assured of a happy ending and everything falls into place incredibly neatly. There's a stability in the predictability of the books which I enjoy.
