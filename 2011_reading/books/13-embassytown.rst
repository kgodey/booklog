Embassytown by China Mi√©ville
=============================

This book was excellent. When I first started reading it, I appreciated it mostly for the ideas and the writing (Language is really cool!) I was afraid that that the characters would be flat and there would not be much of an emotional core to the book. I was happy to be proven wrong - the book delivers on every count.
